# gba-dev
this repository is a collection of resources for gba rom development.

I'm going to add to it myself, the homies are also welcome to open up PRs and upload some markdown docs, music, art, assets, code, etc. I'm guessing we'll want to move most of the assets to Google Drive or something better. I'll keep my docs and code here though because version control is nice.
